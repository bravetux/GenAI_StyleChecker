- Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants.

## Comments
- Use `#` for single-line comments.
- Use docstrings for module, class, and method documentation.

## Other Guidelines
- Use type hints where applicable.
- Follow PEP 8 for additional style rules.
- Avoid using wildcard imports (e.g., `from module import *`).
